    COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'export' THEN 1 END) as exports,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as unique_sessions,
    AVG(CASE WHEN event_type = 'calculation' THEN principal END) as avg_loan_amount
FROM analytics_events 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Data Retention Policy
